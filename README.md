# Keep calm and move around the bugs

===============================

### 1st - HOW to RUN the GAME
Open the [Arcarde-Game](https://bluessista.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) The Game will start with your first move. A move is when you press one of your arrow keys on the keyboard.

### 2nd - HOW to PLAY the GAME 
You are the little Girl on the grass.
Bring her save to the water without colliding with a bug. Bugs are evil and we don't want them. Moving on to the very left or very right will bring you to the opposite site.

If you reached the water savely, the game is done and you can start again by clicking on the success modal window. Again, as soon as you do your first move, the game will start.

#Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

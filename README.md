### 2nd - HOW to RUN the GAME online
Open the [Arcade-Game](https://bluessista.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/) (<-- by clicking the link) in the Browser.  

### 3rd - HOW to PLAY the GAME 
You are the little Girl on the grass. The Game will start with your first move. A move is when you press your arrow keys on the keyboard.

Bring her save to the water without colliding with any bug. Bugs are evil and we don't like them. Moving on to the very left or very right will bring you to the opposite site of the game board.

If you reached the water savely, the game is done and you can start again by clicking on the success modal window. Again, as soon as you do your first move, the game will start.

#### Student instructions
#Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
